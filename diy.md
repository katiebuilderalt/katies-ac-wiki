In *[Animal Crossing: New Horizons](/animal-crossing_-new-horizons)*, DIY is an essential mechanic in the game. Once Tom Nook hands the user their NookPhone, the user will have access to the DIY Recipes app. The app lets the player catalog recipes and see what materials are in their pockets. The app is synced with all DIY workbenches. The app also lets players bookmark recipes, see what they have and haven't crafted, and what items are currently located in the player's pockets. In game version 2.0, the app can get upgraded by the "Be a Chef! DIY Recipes+" via the Nook Stop and gain access to cooking recipes via kitchenware. Even though all recipes are in the app, players need to craft DIY recipes at a workbench and Cooking recipes at a kitchenware item.
